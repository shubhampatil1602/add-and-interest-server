## Learnings

This project covers the following learning tasks:

1. **Frontend - Backend Communication:**
   - Understanding and implementing communication between the frontend and backend.
   - Creating an interface for users to input data on the frontend and sending requests to the backend for processing.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - Writing backend logic for addition of two numbers and interest calculations.
   - Organizing the backend code in the `backend` folder, specifically in the `index.js` file.

## Running the Project Locally

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
     ```
     git clone <repository_url>
     
     ```

2. **Setup Backend:**
   - Open a terminal in the `backend` folder.
   - Run the following commands:
     ```
     npm install
     
     ```
  
     ```
     nodemon index.js
     
     ```
     - This will install the required dependencies and start the server on port 3000.

3. **Run Frontend:**
   - Open `frontend` folder.
   - Copy the path of `index.html` or run it using a live server and add ```/frontend``` at last.

4. **Enjoy:**
   - You should now be able to access and interact with the project locally.

Feel free to explore the code in both the frontend and backend folders to understand how the communication and logic are implemented.

Happy coding!
